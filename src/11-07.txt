If you have thoughts that are mean, selfish, and so on, those are your greatest teachers.

It is the perfect opportunity to see what is happening within, without resorting to theorizing.

In that moment you can go deeper and deeper, sinking into the reality of how your mind is functioning.

It is extremely beautiful to behold.
